  - The dataset organised into three tables **Products**, **Customers** & **Orders** provides insights into Myntra’s sales activity, consisting of **3,500** orders placed by **100** customers across **3,071** unique products.

### 5) Business Problem❗
Myntra wants to enhance customer retention and maximize sales revenue by understanding purchasing behavior across its wide product catalog. Despite having data on Products, Customers & Orders there's limited visibility into:
  - Which products or categories drive the most revenue.
  - Seasonal or trend-based variations in demand.
  - Opportunities to cross-sell or upsell to existing customers.
  - Customer Satisfaction level.
  - Regional Demographics.
Without these insights, Myntra risks losing customers to competitors and missing growth opportunities in a highly competitive fashion e-commerce market.
