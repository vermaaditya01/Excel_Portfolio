Myntra wants to enhance customer retention and maximize sales revenue by understanding purchasing behavior across its wide product catalog. Despite having data on Products, Customers & Orders there's limited visibility into:

Without these insights, Myntra risks losing customers to competitors and missing growth opportunities in a highly competitive fashion e-commerce market.
